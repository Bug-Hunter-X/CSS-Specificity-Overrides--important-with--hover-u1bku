To solve this, avoid using `!important`. Instead, refactor your CSS selectors to achieve the desired result with proper specificity. One solution might involve using a more specific selector for the `:hover` state or adjusting your CSS structure.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child:hover {
  color: green;
}
```

This revised CSS uses a more specific selector for the hover state, ensuring the green color is applied correctly without relying on `!important`.  Alternatively, consider restructuring the parent-child relationship and selectors to align with specificity rules.
